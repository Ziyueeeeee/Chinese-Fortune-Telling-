1.No_Deficit
In your birth chart, the elements dance in balance, a symphony divine,
No excess, no dearth, a harmony, a cosmic design.
Earth, Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water entwine,
A spell of equilibrium, a potion so fine.
No glaring tilt, no void profound,
A witch's whisper, a cosmic sound.
In this mystic blend, where energies align,
Stability and balance, in every sign.
Elements entwined, a magical brew,
A cosmic dance, a harmonious view.
In the cauldron of fate, a balanced swirl,
Steadfast and serene, in this cosmic twirl.

2.Wood
Wood, the essence of kindness, unfolds with grace,
Its nature straightforward, a harmonious embrace.
In taste, a hint of sour, in hue, a shade of green,
Yet for those lacking Wood, a slender frame is seen.
Sparse is the mane, the stature thin and tall,
Character constricted, envy's bitter thrall.
To mend this void, to broaden and refine,
Restore the Wood, let benevolence shine.

3.Fire
In the realm of Fire, a spirit ablaze,
Urgency in nature, a demeanor that's raised.
Bitter in taste, a hue so red,
Yet lacking Fire, a soul may dread.
Yellowed and lean, sharp in speech,
Deception and envy within their reach.
Deeds left incomplete, a wandering fire,
To replenish this flame, the heart aspires.
In the cosmic ballet, where elements play,
A fiery spirit, in the vibrant array.
To restore the balance, let the flames ascend,
A journey within, where passions blend.

4.Earth
In the realm of Earth, a spirit profound,
A nature steadfast, a heart that's sound.
Sweetness in taste, a hue so mellow,
A soul anchored deep, like a golden willow.
For those who lack Earth in their cosmic score,
Complexion dimmed, and a nose low and more.
A touch malevolent, a spirit awry,
Trust shattered, a soul that's dry.
In the dance of elements, when Earth is sparse,
A changeful spirit, like shadows that parse.
No constancy, in deeds or creed,
A mercurial soul, in thoughts and need.
To replenish Earth, let the spirit mend,
With steadfast virtues, a journey to transcend.
In the cosmic play, let balance unfurl,
A grounded heart, in this magical swirl.

5.Metal
In the realm where metals shine, a spirit may wade,
A resolute nature, in the heart's cool shade.
Yet, in the absence of that gleaming light,
A softer temperament, lost in the night.
Like petals yearning for the metal's embrace,
A fragility that time may efface.
In the cosmic dance, a yearning theme,
For the missing gleam, in the metal's dream.
In health's reflection, signs may arise,
Subtle whispers, beneath pale skies.
A respiratory dance, sensitivity's kin,
In the alchemy of life, a metal's whim.

6.Water
In the realm where waters flow, a spirit may lack,
A core essence absent, steering off track.
Impulsive and hasty, words may take flight,
Yet self-awareness may lack its full light.
With passions ablaze, yet fleeting and brief,
A wavering heart, battling belief.
Perseverance falters, decisions deferred,
In the cosmic dance, where waters are stirred.
Health's melody echoes, where waters decline,
Kidney's whispers, a subtle sign.
Issues of urinary kin, in shadows may loom,
A call for balance, in life's vast room.
For some, a weakened back may confide,
Lumbar strains, where waters subside.
Skin may whisper, tales of drought,
In this cosmic ballet, balance sought.
