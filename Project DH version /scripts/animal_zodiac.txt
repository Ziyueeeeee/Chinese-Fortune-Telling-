1.Rat
People born in the Year of the Rat are easy to get along with, hardworking, and live a very frugal life. Unless they really like someone, they won't easily spend money.

On the outside, Rat individuals may appear quiet, but in reality, they can be impulsive, yet they can control themselves. This is why they are popular and have many friends. Rats are naturally clever, diligent, and focus on saving, usually without worrying about their basic needs. In middle age, they may have substantial savings but are cautious, preferring to keep their money in the bank for a stable interest rather than investing in the stock market.
In the latter part of their lives, Rats continue to lead a stable and comfortable life, often better than the first half. Their charming personality is as irresistible as Walt Disney's portrayal of Mickey Mouse. They are honest, straightforward, cheerful, and optimistic.

When faced with setbacks or failures, they quickly make decisions and start anew until they succeed. They also enjoy debating and never back down from an argument.
