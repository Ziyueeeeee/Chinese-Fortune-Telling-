1.Wood
In the dance of destiny, Water and Wood lend their aiding hands,
A symphony of support, where the Day Master finds its stand.
Yet Fire, Earth, and Metal, with opposing might,
Diminish and temper, in destiny's cosmic flight.

2.Fire
Your essence, a dance of fiery hue,
Wood and fire, companions true.
But tread with care, for earth, gold, and sea,
May quench the flames, a cautionary decree.

3.Earth 
In the realm of earth, your essence thrives,
With fire and soil, a harmony survives.
Yet be wary, for metal, water, and wood,
May challenge the balance, as caution should.

4.Metal
In the golden embrace, your essence gleams,
With earth and metal, harmonious dreams.
Yet caution looms, for water, wood, and fire,
May challenge your brilliance, testing your pyre. 

5.Water
In the realm of water, your essence flows,
With metal and water, a synergy grows.
Yet beware, for wood, fire, and earthly might,
May disrupt the harmony, casting shadows on your light.
